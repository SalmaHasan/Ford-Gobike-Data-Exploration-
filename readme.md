# Ford Gobike Data Exploration
## by Salma Hasan AbokamarÂ¶


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
How long does the average trip take?(duration)
Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
1. import libraries 
2. read data 
3. see data info 
4. changing data type
5. drop unwanted col.
6. copy data for specific cleaning
7. drop the column that do not have any NaN/None values
8. Converting the seconds into minutes for better understanding of the graph.



## Summary of Findings

Males are more than females with large number in difference 
 user type of it is Subscribers are more than customers
 huge number of missing values in birth year and gender that maybe effevt on our findings 
 there are alot of outliers in our variable of interest 
 Trip duration values first increases and reach to tha peak the duration of the trip is around 5 min
the graph is right skewed
it is appear that most of trips are in bet 20 and less than 80 years and it about 10000 durations 
most common one is 'San Francisco'
some stations are equals in counts 
other rides longer trips then males although number of males are larger
the higher duration trip is higher for male but percentage is higher for women and other, also other has one more peak at nearly the age of 30 years for higher duration time, for female is about two peaks
